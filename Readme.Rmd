## invMovements: R functions to identify movements in light-level geolocation data

The identification of movements in light level geolocation data is of prime interest, since it can significantly improve track estimates using the `groupedThresholdModel` in the R package [SGAT](https://github.com/SWotherspoon/SGAT). Different to most other track estimation method, where the location of each identified twilight event or twilight period will estimated, the `groupedThresholdModel` uses prior knowledge on whether a twilight event or a sequence of twilight events were likely recorded at one location, without intermittent movements, and subsequently estimates single best locations for these stationary periods with associated credibility intervals. In doing so, the location estimates of stationary periods (e.g. stopovers, major non-breeding sites) seem to get a more accurate estimate and outliers (caused by e.g. strong shading during twilight) in twilight times are less influential. For more information see @Lisovski_2020 and Chapter 7 _The Group Model_ in the [geolocation manual](https://geolocationmanual.vogelwarte.ch/). 

However, the identification of movements in a series of twilight events is rather complicated. Most twilight events in geolocationd datasets (identified via the threshold method: see @Lisovski_2020) are somewhat inaccurate since the logger recording light intensities on the animal is rarely exposed to the unobscured sun; clouds, rain, vegetation, mountains, feathers, are all factors that can alter the true light intensity. Thus, movements and the associated changes in twilight times can only be detected of the difference in sunrise or sunset times is larger than the error in the twilight events. And secondly, the magnitude of the changes in twilight times caused by movements depends (besides distance) on the bearing and the time of the year; some movements may only cause changes in either sunrise and sunset times.

The R package `GeoLight` [@Lisovski_GeoLight] includes a function that uses _changepoint_ analyses to identify changes in twilight events (see chapter 3 _Movement analyses_ of the [geolocation manual](https://geolocationmanual.vogelwarte.ch/)). While the `changeLight` function seem to work in many instances and provided acceptable results for lots of datasets, the analytically process in the function is not exactly correct and probably too simplistic (not accounting for the error structure of the data). Most significantly, the changepoint analysis assumes a normal distribution of the error in the data, in this case the twilight events. However, the error in twilight times is known to follow a _log-normal_ or a _gamma_ distribution (see Figure 1).

Here, I aim to present the R package `invMovement` allowing investigation of potential movements based on the error structure of the underlying twilight error distribution.

The following functions are part of the R package `invMovement`:

* invChanges
* extractMovements
* gammaSens
* groupSensitivity
* groupSummary
* mergeGroups
