## Overview

`{chess}` is an *opinionated* wrapper for R around
[python-chess](https://github.com/niklasf/python-chess), an amazing
library created by [Niklas Fiekas](https://github.com/niklasf). It
allows users to read and write
[PGN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Game_Notation) files as
well as create and explore game trees such as the ones seen in chess
books.

## Installation

Install the released version of `{chess}` from CRAN:

``` r
install.packages("chess")
```

Or install the development version from GitHub with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("curso-r/chess")
```
